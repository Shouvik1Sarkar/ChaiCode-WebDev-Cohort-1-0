## 2 types of Data Structure -> 1. Primitive (array, object) 2. Non-Primitive (stack, queue, linked list) // Need to understand more.

## Array -> sequential.

## Object -> key value pair.

## An array can be a property of an object.

## an object or function can be property of an object.

## Two types of memory- Stack and Heap.

## Primitives are stored in "Stack" and Non-Primitives are stored in "Heap".

## Stack can't grow dynamically but heap is.

## stack - reads faster but can't grow.

## heap - can grow but reads slow.

## Garbage collector.

## Memory leak.

## so when we write ob1 = ob2 we don't actually copy the object rather we copy the reference of that object.

## But what if we want to copy the object and the value not the reference? what will we do?

## Shallow copy and deep copy

## serialization and deserialization of JSON(or trees in dsa)

## JSON parse, code highlight

## (pickling in python)

## Object to string (Serialization of JSON) AND string to Object (De-Serialization of JSON)

## teleportation is also Serialization and Deserialization of a human. Human to Binary, Binary to human
